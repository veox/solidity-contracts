# chal2sweep

A simple dapp to sweep a fixed number of ether from @Sjors Challenge 2,
discussed in [dao-challenge/issues/1](https://github.com/Sjors/dao-challenge/issues/1).

A contract is not needed to do this, a call is sufficient.

The contract has been deployed at
[0x6a3120d8..](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6a3120d8a66fe96eb260cce4b6da02e7835b8426)
- but half an hour too late. @Sjors has noticed the bug in time.
