*.sol are so bare that any kind of licensing is absurd.

*.asm are produced by `solc` compiler, not sure what applies here.
*.disasm are produced by Nick Johnson's `evmdis` disassembler, same
issue.

Just in case it's up to me in your jurisdiction, I hereby place the
files in this directory into public domain.

It probably isn't up to me though, so consult a lawyer, a priest,
your own common sense, or the underlying fabric of reality, - whichever
is most readily available.
